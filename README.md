# Don't forget to
- `pip install virtualenv`
- `virtualenv venv` - i.e. create a virtual environment
- `source venv/bin/activate`-linux/Mac OS or `venv\Scripts\activate`-Windows
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the requirements
That's probably all, I'm not entirely sure. 

Then you may run code from inside virtual environment
 
If you want to get out of virtual environment:
- `deactivate`

Hopefully this helps
